        <h1>GeminiBlu.com Review: Is GeminiBlu Limited a Legit Forex Broker?</h1>

        <p><strong>GeminiBlu.com review</strong> reveals a suspicious and likely deceptive setup masquerading as a professional Forex and CFDs broker. While the website uses sleek design and industry jargon to project credibility, deeper analysis raises several red flags.</p>

        <h2>Domain History and Timeline</h2>
        <p>The domain <strong>geminiblu.com</strong> was initially registered in 2008. According to <a href="https://lookup.icann.org/en/lookup" target="_blank">ICANN Lookup</a>, it was updated in May 2025. Historical data from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240701000000*/geminiblu.com" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> shows it was previously used for selling e-learning materials until it went inactive in 2016. The domain was then repurposed in 2025 by a new entity now posing as a brokerage platform. </p>

        <p>This practice is common among shady financial projects that want to appear older and more established than they really are, fooling potential clients into assuming a long track record of service.</p>

        <h2>Who Owns GeminiBlu?</h2>
        <p>The company behind the project appears to be <strong>GeminiBlu Limited</strong>, registered in Manchester, UK in April 2025. This aligns perfectly with the timeframe when the broker site began operations. According to <a href="https://www.endole.co.uk">Endole.co.uk</a>, the company is newly incorporated and has no financial or operational history in the financial markets.</p>

        <h2>Is GeminiBlu Licensed?</h2>
        <p>One of the major red flags in this <strong>GeminiBlu review</strong> is the broker’s claim of being licensed by the FCA, FinCEN, and MSB. However, a check on the <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/search?q=Geminiblu%20Limited&type=Companies" target="_blank">FCA Register</a> reveals no listing for GeminiBlu Limited. FinCEN and MSB registrations are not licenses for forex brokerage operations either.</p>

        <p>The so-called <strong>MSB Registration Number: 31000293629205</strong> displayed in the website’s footer is vague and unverifiable. No physical address or meaningful regulatory proof is provided.</p>

        <h2>Deceptive Marketing and Fake Claims</h2>
        <p>GeminiBlu’s website is bloated with marketing buzzwords such as “cutting-edge features” and “universal accessibility,” which add no real value. They claim to serve over 500,000 traders and boast an average payout of $18.7 million monthly—yet the website itself has only been live for a few weeks.</p>

        <p>Such blatant misrepresentation is a major concern and should not be ignored by prospective investors. Their statistics appear entirely fabricated to lure in unsuspecting users.</p>

        <h2>So, Is geminiblu.com a Scam?</h2>
        <p>In light of the above, it’s fair to question, <strong>Is Gemini Blu legit?</strong> All evidence points to a high likelihood that this is a scam operation. From unverified licensing, misleading claims, and an opaque ownership structure, <strong>GeminiBlu Limited</strong> does not meet the standards of a trustworthy financial service provider.</p>

        <p>Investors should exercise extreme caution and avoid depositing any funds with this broker.</p>
